# Exercise 5: Mapping Through A List And Rendering

To get comfortable with React, you must learn declarative programming.

React is declarative. So you need to think in "declarative programming" whenever you work with React, and this exercise is perfect for that. This is the "opposite" of imperative programming which is the paradigm used in Vanilla JavaScript.

In this exercise, instead of manually and "imperatively" coding the render of each item in a list, use the map function to "declare" how React should render the list.

Given an array:

`['dog', 'cat', 'chicken', 'cow', 'sheep', 'horse']`

Use the map function to render them in an unordered list:

-   dog
-   cat
-   chicken
-   cow
-   horse
