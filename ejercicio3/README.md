# Exercise 3: Custom Component

In the previous exercise, we used the HTML  `<button>`  tag. But  **much of the power that React provides to us developers is being able to create our own components and reuse them.**

You'll be creating more complicated custom components than a simple button in the near future, but we all gotta start somewhere.

In this exercise, build your own Button component and render it three times. On user click, it should alert which button was clicked.

The custom component should accept an  `onClick`  prop. On render, it should render the children between the button. This is the text you want for the button.

Think of it like the HTML  `<button>`  tag. Whatever text you place between the opening and closing tag is rendered between the button when you inspect the element in your browser developer console.

On user click, it should alert which button was clicked.
