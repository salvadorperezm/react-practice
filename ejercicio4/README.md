# Exercise 4: State and Props

So you're comfortable working with props, congratulations! Using props allows us to pass values or functions down to a child component.

State is another integral concept we must learn in React. It allows us to store values, and React automatically updates our UI when the values change.

**That's one of the many beautiful things with React.**  We don't need to manually handle these things - React does the UI re-rendering for us when a value changes. But we must know how to use the state for this purpose.

This exercise is simple, and is a very common React tutorial out there. Use the  `useState`  React hook to track how many times a button is clicked, and display the number.

The number must increment each time the button is clicked.
