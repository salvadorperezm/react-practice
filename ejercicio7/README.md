# Exercise 7: Building A Form

Unleash some more power from React by building a form. React is great for this.

Build a form that accepts a first name and a last name. And instead of a boring "Submit" button, make a button that says "Greet Me" that when clicked, will alert "Hello [first name] [last name]!".

Here you will use a combination of concepts from previous exercises, such as using state, and event listening both on text input and button click.
